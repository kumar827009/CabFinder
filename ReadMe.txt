This contains scala Akka-HTTP based HTTP server for Taxi aggregation/Driver Finder

Why Akka ?
---------
The Akka HTTP modules implement a full server- and client-side HTTP stack on top
of akka-actor and akka-stream. It's not a web-framework but rather a more general
toolkit for providing and consuming HTTP-based services.

 Akka provides highly concurrent and non-blocking asynchronous processing
